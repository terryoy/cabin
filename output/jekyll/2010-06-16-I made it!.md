From Shenzhen to Panyu(at least it's a part of Guangzhou)! All along the road,
by bike!

It was a brave try. Not much preparation is done, but all by myself. With only
a few pages of map printed from Baidu Map, a bag and a bike, I decided to go.
After a whole day, my skin got sun-burned, and my body was so tired that can
hardly move, but I finally made it to the destination.

I can't say that everybody will find it fun, but I still enjoy myself out of
such total exhaustion.  One is for that I can succeed myself in such a tough
challenge; the other reason is that travelling across the towns and the
countries, small chats with local people, eating and drinking whenever you
feel like in any places, all these things could bring you much special
experience to amuse yourself.

This time I really can't afford time to take many photos. I think I can put it
to my next bicycle journey and from then on. :)
