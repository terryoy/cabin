"In the 5 years and 377 games that he played in the Kings uniform. He averaged
23.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, nearly 5 assists. He lead this club to 2 back-to-
back pacific division championships, made the playoffs every year. 4 times he
was in the all-star where  representing a Sacramento King. He was all-NBA
first team in the 2000-2001 season.

But it wasn't just the numbers that he put up. There was a big smile that can
only light up a room, or a whole arena. There was a manner in which he
embraced this community, somewhat we reluctantly at fisrt. But a real love
affair, began a blossom. We're proud of that. We love the way that he
interacts with you fans, particularly with the kids.

Chris Webber, we're so appreciative of the memory you left with us with. We
love the smile. We love the interaction. And we're so very very proud that
you're going to join that group right up there."

有许多原因令我曾经对NBA疯狂的着迷，而Chris Webber就是其中的一个。尽管Sacramento
Kings从未得到过一个总冠军，但是在无数球迷心目中，他们仍然是“Kings Without Crown”。Chris
Webber的微笑，精湛全面的技术，极具天赋的篮球智商，不光为Sacramento这座城市带来了光芒，同时也为NBA联盟带来了革命性的新时代。

C.Webber带领着密歇根五虎打NCAA决赛时，因最后时刻的一个关键的暂停失误使他们丢失了冠军。在国王时期，多次与西部列强争夺中输掉了运气，02年西区决赛Horry匪夷所思的绝杀，03年跟小牛厮杀得伤兵满营，04年跟森林狼尖峰对决Webber最后一投绕框而出，让所有国王球迷无不扼腕。C.Webber的灵气为国王队带来了堪称一绝的行云流水赏心悦目的进攻。当时的国王队是联盟内唯一真正有贵族豪气的球队，是无数球迷心中真正的帝王。如今C.Webber的4号球衣高高地悬挂在Sacramento的ARCO球馆，那个充满了回忆的地方。

愿Webber的精神永远存在于球迷心中！
