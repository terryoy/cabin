Why am I here? (- Your 'Purpose')

Where am I going with my purpose? (- Your 'Vision'. And don't mixed up the
purpose and the vision)

How am I to live out my purpose in regard to specific areas of my life today?
(- Your 'Mission')

What will be the manner or style for my conduct? (-Your 'Philosophy', your
personal ethics, your sense of right and wrong)

What am I willing to do to achieve? (-Your 'Commitment')

\- from , Kevin W.McCarthy

这只是一本普通的励志书。让我感兴趣的是书上一个叫做Joshua的人的笔迹（由于是二手书，所以有别人的笔迹），工整地在空白页上给一位中国朋友写的一封信：

I often read books such as this to keep my spirits high and to keep believing
that anything is possible. ...  
Chase your dreams as fast as you can - without dreams we are just roaming
animals. ...

不知道何种原因这本书有幸来到我手上，不过可以感受到这位陌生朋友的友谊和鼓励，让我思考了一下存在的意义，生活的目的。
