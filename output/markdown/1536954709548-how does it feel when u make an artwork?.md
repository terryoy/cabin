recently i'm considering what project should i accomplish(because i have to
show it or talk about it when i have interview next term), but i don't know
whether these some like twenty days are enough for me to make something. on
one side i think that an artwork may take very long time, to make it available
for my interview, i may have to cut it short. but on the other side, if i cut
it short, it may just look like nothing, so i just show nothing to
others...this problem always annoys me when i decide to do something.



but there is a saying, "when you start to do something, it gets easier than
you think...". for me, i should have try to start it before much thinking.
sometimes thinking too much will just stop you forward.
