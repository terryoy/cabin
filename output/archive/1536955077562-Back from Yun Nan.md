Gotta write something, already missed last week's post.

It's the first time I travel by myself, and also the first time to spend the
nights in youth hostels. It was an interesting experience meeting people from
different places, at their different ages, with different backgrounds. Most of
them are open-minded, warm and kind-hearted people, and are often willing to
give helpful advices or share their stories.

During the days, I also found cycling in country side very enjoyable. The
fresh air and the beautiful mountain view makes me feel like shooting a road
movie. Sometimes running away from the clouds and the rain over my head, and
sometimes tracing the wind and the sun. I'm considering buying a bike in
Shenzhen so I can spend some of my spare time cycling around the city too.

I like one saying, "The purpose of travel is not to show off, nor to follow
anyone's footsteps. It's a journey to think, to find oneself's shallowness and
humbleness, and finally come to a distillation of one's mind."
