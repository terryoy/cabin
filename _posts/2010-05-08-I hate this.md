stupid promises…always trying to be a nice guy, which only hurts myself.

It’s all paying back. It would be quite sad when it finally ends, for it would
be the last promise from my innocent  age.

A great man should be strong enough to admit the life’s disappointment, then
keep smiling and move on.
